# Hotel Management System (Java Console App)

A simple console-based Java program that allows users to manage hotel rooms, check availability, book rooms, order food, and handle checkouts. The program uses basic Java I/O and object serialization to persist data between sessions. 
<br>This project was created as a learning exercise to practice basic Java and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
